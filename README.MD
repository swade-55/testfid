Fidelity Account Overview App
tl;dr:

Assuming you have at least one Fidelity account.

Go to the "Accounts & Trade" -> "Account Position" page
Click the "Download" button on the right side of the page
Either drag the csv into the app from your browser downloads or find it in your files / documents to upload it
Optionally filter certain accounts or trading symbols
DISCLAIMER:

I'm not interested in your data, it is not uploaded anywhere besides to the streamlit process that serves your charts. This application does require you uploading information to the streamlit cloud server unless you self-host it (See Local Setup below).

Act within reason; this app follows the Fidelity terms that the data is for your own informational purposes only.

What is this?
A web app I built to visualize my current account standings in my brokerage accounts. Fidelity doesn't provide API access to my knowledge, but downloading an account summary CSV is somewhat convenient.

The idea is not specific to Fidelity, it just happens to be where I have accounts. It would work with any csv with the needed columns.

Built with ❤️ from Gar's Bar. Powered by Streamlit, pandas, plotly, and streamlit-aggrid.

Sample Data
If you just want to see it in action, no worries. I've included a set of example data that mimics the data shape I get from my real account. The numbers won't add up and the stocks don't exist; for demonstration only.

Local Setup
Assumes you have a working python 3.9 installation.

git clone git@github.com:gerardrbentley/fidelity-account-overview.git
cd fidelity-account-overview

python -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate for windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
Further Ideas
This was the basic idea for me to get a better look at my accounts and picks breakdown.

A better version of this would be able to track changes over time or provide some forecasting prediction.
